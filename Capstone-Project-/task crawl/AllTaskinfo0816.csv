Standard Airtasker cleaning tasks should include:

- Everywhere in the house: Wiping down furniture and visible surfaces; Mop and vacuum floors; Empty rubbish
- Bathrooms: Cleaning showers, bathtub and toilets;
- Kitchen: Washing dishes;

I would also like the following cleaning tasks included:
- Linen changed on all beds (will have clean sheets ready to go)
- Windows (interior side) cleaned - should be about 1 hour


*This task was created using a Template.  You can still ask questions and make offers as you would on a standard task.

Build barn doors and install ,Bree J.,"Bacchus Marsh VIC, Australia","Sunday, 30th May 2021",$600,"I am looking for someone who can build two barn doors to section off my front lounge room/ TV room

I am also looking for someone who can then install the barn doors

I’d prefer the doors be attached to iron for a rustic effect. 

Barn doors should be in industrial style wood as I like wood which has character to it. Must be stained / varnished 

Happy for someone to come and measure the space to ensure they have correct measurements and can work out how to mount the doors 

Flexible with installation date etc 

I am located in Bacchus Marsh
